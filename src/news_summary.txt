The best Nintendo Switch games to play as a family - Kelsey Chapman
If you're a Nintendo person, you're already familiar with the Smash Bros. and their antics, but now you can welcome new fighters Simon Belmont and King K. Rool into the proverbial ring with "enhanced speed and combat at new stages."
As one thrilled buyer reports, "It's in no way perfect, but there's just so much good that I don't see how anybody can be sad.
It's a game I'm going to be playing for years, and I'm going to enjoy it for years."

Things have got messier for Ellie and Joel, as they live in the rubble of that costly decision; each gasp for air fills their lungs with its dust.
There are no true villains, or perhaps there are only villains – in the game’s world, violence metastasises readily and horribly, its own kind of infection.
The Last of Us Part II is a bleak, distressing game, and tremendously violent.
Unlike many gore-filled games, though, The Last of Us Part II interrogates its own existence: violence is part of both medium and message.
